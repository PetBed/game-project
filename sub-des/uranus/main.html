            <div id="intro">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Uranus</strong> is the seventh planet from the Sun and has the third largest diameter our solar system.
                    Uranus is very cold and windy and rotates at a nearly 90 degree angle from its plane of orbit.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Uranus is formed around 4.5 billion years ago with a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers).
                    From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is 19.8 astronomical units 
                    away from the Sun<a href="#footnotes">*</a>. 
                    It takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes for light from the Sun to reach Saturn. <br>

                    <strong>Potential for Life:</strong> <br>
                    Uranus's environment is not too conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures and materials are most likey too 
                    extreme and volatile for living organisms to adapt to.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Orbit and Rotation:</strong>  <br>
                    A day on Uranus takes about 17 hours, and completes and orbit around the Sun in about 84 Earth years. Uranus is the only planet 
                    whos nearly orbiting at a right angle - with a axis of rotation of 97.77 degrees. The tilt is probably caused from a collision 
                    with a Earth like planet. This tilt causes the most extreme seasons in the solar system.
                    This means that, like Earth, Saturn experiences seasons.<br><br>
                    <strong>Structure:</strong>  <br>
                    Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium. Its core consists of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material. 
                    It is hard to imagine but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system with an average density lower than water. <br><br>
                    <strong>Temperatures:</strong>  <br>
                    The temperature on Saturn is around minus 140 degrees Celsius (minus 220 degrees Fahrenheit), a lot more colder than Jupiter, since its further 
                    from the Sun.<br><br>
                    <strong>Surface:</strong> <br>
                    As a gas giant, Saturn doesnâ€™t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. <br><br>
                    <strong>Atmosphere:</strong> <br>
                    Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes. The planet is many different shades of yellow, brown, and gray. 
                    Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters per second. In contrast, the fastest wind speed ever recorded on Earth is just 
                    around 113 meters per second.<br><br>
                    <strong>Magetosphere:</strong> <br>
                    Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578 times as powerful as Earth's. Like Jupiter, Saturn's aurorae are not created 
                    from the solar winds, but rather from Saturn's moons and Saturn's magnetic field's rapid rotation rate. <br><br>
                    <strong>Moons: </strong> <br>
                    Saturn is home to a vast array of moons. From haze-shrouded Titan to crater-riddled Phoebe, each of them tells a diffirent story surrounding 
                    the Saturn system. Saturn has 53 confirmed moons and 29 more awaiting confirmation. <br><br>
                    <strong>Rings: </strong> <br>
                    The rings are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials such as dust. Saturn's ring system extends up to 
                    175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is typically about 10 meters in the main rings<a href="#footnotes">**</a>.
