            <div id="intro">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Venus</strong> is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth' closest planetary neighbour.
                    It is also often called Earth's twin because it's similar in size and density.
                    Venus is known as the "Morning and Evening Star" because it is one of the brightest objects in the sky
                    when viewed from earth. It is always found near the sun and it rises and sets each day.<br>
                    Venus's surface is often described as a "hellscape" due to thousands of volcanos and crushing air pressure 
                    on its surface.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Venus is formed around 4.6 billion years ago. With a radius of 3760 miles (6052 kilometers), 
                    and it is almost as big as Earth.
                    From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon. Venus also has phases, just like our Moon 
                    - only that it takes 584 days to complete a cycle.

                    <strong>Orbit and Rotation:</strong> Mercury completes an orbit around the Sun every 88 days, travelling through space at nearly 29 miles 
                    (47 kilometers) per second. Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. Mercury's axis 
                    of rotation is tilted just about 2 degrees. And so it doesn't experience seasons as many other planets do. <br>
                    <strong>Structure:</strong> Mercury is the second densest planet with a large metallic code with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers)
                    Mercury's outer shell<a href="#footnotes">**</a> is only about 250 miles (400 kilometers) thick.<br>
                    <strong>Surface:</strong> Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's moon - scarred by many impact craters from collisions with meteoroids
                    and comets. To the human eye, Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown. <br>
                    <strong>Temperatures:</strong> During the day, temperatures on the surface can reach 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) and since there
                    isn't any atmosphere to retain the heat, the temperature can drop to -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit). <br>
                    <strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Mercury doesn't have an atmosphere, but possesses a thin exophere that is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen,
                    helium and potassium.
                    <strong>Magetosphere:</strong> Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator and the strength of the magnetic field is only
                    1% that of Earth's.
