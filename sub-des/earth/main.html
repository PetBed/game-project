                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Earth</strong> is the third planet from the Sun and is our home planet.
                    It's also the only planet that we know of so far that's inhabited by living beings. While Earth is the 
                    5th largest planet, it is the only planet in the solar system with liquid water on its surface, 
                    thus earning the nickname, The Blue Planet. It's slightly larger than Venus and is 
                    the biggest among the four terrestrial<a href="#footnotes">*</a> planets.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Earth is formed around 4.5 billion years ago, with a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers).
                    From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly
                    one astronomical unit away from the Sun.<a href="#footnotes">**</a> 
                    It takes about 8 minutes for light from the Sun to reach Earth.

                    <strong>Potential for Life:</strong> Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life 
                    abundant here. The temperature here allows liquid water to exist for extended peroid of time and its vast oceans provided 
                    a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago. <br>
                    <strong>Orbit and Rotation:</strong> Earth completes one rotation every 23.9 hours, and one lap around the sun 365.25 days
                    that extra quater of a day will be added every four years as a leap day. The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees.
                    This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons.<br>
                    <strong>Structure:</strong> The structure of Venus is quite similar to that of Earth's. It has an iron core enveloped by a
                    hot-rock mantle with a thin, rocky crust. The crust changes form and sometimes erupts into volcanoes in response to the ebb and 
                    flow of heat and pressure deep beneath the surface.<br>
                    <strong>Surface:</strong> Venus appears to have erased most traces of its early surface due to volcanic and tectonic forces,
                    with the average age of surface dating back to 150 million years ago mixed with some older surfaces.
                    Venus is a landscape of valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes. <br>
                    <strong>Temperatures:</strong> Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system - even though Mercury is closer to the sun.
                    Surface temperatures on Venus is about 475 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit) - hot enough to melt lead.<br>
                    <strong>Atmosphere:</strong>  Venus' atmosphere is one of the extremes. The atmospheric pressure on Venus' surface is about
                    95 times that of Earth's. This is the same pressure found at a depth of 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) below Earth's oceans.
                    The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide - the same gas creating the greenhouse effect<a href="#footnotes">**</a> on Venus and Earth, 
                    with clouds composed of sulfuric acid.<br>
                    <strong>Magetosphere:</strong> Venus does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has
                    what is known as an induced magnetic field. This magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun's 
                    magnetic field and the planet's outer atmosphere.

                <ul>
                    <li>Unlike other planets in our solar system, Venus spins clockwise on its axis.</li>
                    <li>Venus's mass is 4.8673e+24 tonnes or the same as 0.815 Earths.</li>
                    <li>Venus is sometimes called Earth's twin because it's similar in size and structure.</li>
                    <li>Venus is named after the Roman godess of love.</li>
